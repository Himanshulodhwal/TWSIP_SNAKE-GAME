# TWSIP_SNAKE-GAME
# Snake Game in C++

This is a simple Snake game implemented in C++ using the console. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat fruits to increase its length and score.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
2. Try to eat the fruits (represented by 'F') that appear on the screen.
3. Each time the snake eats a fruit, its length increases and your score goes up.
4. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.

## Instructions

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
4. If you want to play again after the game ends, simply press 'y' or 'Y' when prompted.

## Controls

- 'W' or Up Arrow: Move the snake upwards.
- 'S' or Down Arrow: Move the snake downwards.
- 'A' or Left Arrow: Move the snake to the left.
- 'D' or Right Arrow: Move the snake to the right.
- 'X': Quit the game.

## Dependencies

This program uses the <conio.h> and <windows.h> libraries for input and display in the console. Make sure your compiler supports these libraries.

NOTE: If the code is not working properly try to rerun code or try to run in another console.
